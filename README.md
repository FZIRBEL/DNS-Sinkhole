<h1>DNS Sinkhole</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that acts as a DNS sinkhole, intercepting and blocking advertisements and trackers at the network level. By effectively filtering out unwanted content and reducing network traffic, it enhances user privacy and security while improving overall network performance. The term "sinkhole" points to the system's role in "sinking" or redirecting unwanted DNS queries to prevent them from reaching their intended destinations.
